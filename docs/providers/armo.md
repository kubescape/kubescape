[ARMO Platform](https://cloud.armosec.io/account/sign-up) is an enterprise solution based on Kubescape. Itâ€™s a multi-cloud Kubernetes and CI/CD security platform with a single pane of glass including risk analysis, security compliance, misconfiguration, image vulnerability, repository and registry scanning, RBAC visualization, and more.
